## Crime
At first our group wanted to try to obtain crime data by zip code level, but it was determined that was outside our scope of our project for the time that we had to develop our project. We were able to obtain data via the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s) for the years 2014-2019. Within each years worth of data, the only columns that were kept were the Violent Crime, Property Crime, and Population for each city. Crime rates are typically shown in crime rate per 100,000 (see below for a example):

        >The result is then multiplied by 100,000. For example, in 2014 there were 48,650 robberies in California and the population was 38,>499,378. This equals a robbery crime rate of 126.4 per 100,000.
